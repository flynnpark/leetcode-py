## 0207. [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that you **must** take course bi first if you want to take course `a<sub>i</sub>`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### **Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.</code></pre>

#### **Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.</code></pre>

#### **Constraints:**

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.
