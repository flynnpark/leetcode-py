# 0003. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

#### Example 1:

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong> s = "abcabcbb"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.</code></pre>

#### Example 2:

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong> s = "bbbbb"
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is "b", with the length of 1.</code></pre>

#### Example 3:

<pre><code><strong>Input:</strong> s = "pwwkew"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.</code></pre>

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
